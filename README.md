## Introduction
Our product will allow for sustainably creating and selling products between people in the Global North and the Global South. This in turn helps combat climate change and improves the quality of life for sellers living in the global South.
​
## The Problem
- Maritime transport emits around 940 million tonnes of CO2 annually and is responsible for about 2.5% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (3rd IMO GHG study)
- Air cargo accounts for about 4% of global carbon emissions. 
- Recent estimates for global poverty are that 9.2% of the world, or 689 million people, live in extreme poverty on $1.90 or less a day, according to the World Bank.
- 60% of businesses surveyed were closed for some part of 2020 due to COVID-19, and these companies experienced a drop in revenue of 87% compared to 2019.
​
Carbon emission from shipping, whether it is air or maritime, accounts for major percentage of the global emissions. As the world moves online due to the corona virus, more and more people will resort to E-commerce websites, which will in turn raise the carbon emissions from shipping even more. People depending on seller to client interaction, or depending on tourists coming to their countries, suffer a lot financially. 
​
## Our Solution
 To combat this we came up with a system that almost eliminates the carbon footprint created by shipping globally.
​
​
We will do this using our web platform, which allows sellers to send in a prototype of their products to us. We will then create a 3D scan of the product and upload the product to the website. When a buyer  visits the website they are presented with product designs available for purchase ordered by country. When a product is bought, we use the scan to create a 3D model of the product, which is then shipped to the buyer. This eliminates the need to ship the product from the seller’s country, which in turn decreasing the overall carbon footprint. This also provides an income to communities in the Global South, which will in turn increase the quality of life over a longer period of time.
​
​
We also added a learning platform onto the website. As the platform expands, we will ask communities to share their skills in the form of a tutorial video, which we would put together using footage that we gather,. We would pay them to do the tutorials, and it would effectively allow communities to share with each other. Since the videos may be in languages which they are not familiar with, we will use the IBM language translator on expansion to solve this problem.
​
There’s also the donation section, which allows people to donate to specific sellers, or to our startup, which would help us to expand on the services we offer at the moment.

## Market and Business Model

​
People from the global south will get their revenue stream whenever a user buys a product from him on the website. We will take a 5% commission from them so as to keep the system running. Sellers will also have the possibility of paying us to get their products featured on our landing page. Buyers will have the possibility to donate to specific sellers or to our startup, which would help us expand and provide better services for even more people.
